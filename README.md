# BachelorProefBackend

## Desciption
This project was created as a bachelor thesis from three students industrial engineering, electronics - ICT.
You can find the repository for the corresponding web application here: https://github.com/WannesVermeire/BachelorProefFrontend.git
And the corresponding mobile application here: https://github.com/WoutDeleu/BachelorProefApp_V3.git

## Functionality
This code contains a connection to a PostgreSQL database and implements URLs to implement most CRUD operations on the data conveniently.
Furthermore it allows the user to log in and implements multiple security checks based on the login information contained in de JSON Web Token.

## Usage
You can run the code as is, then you will connect to our online database hosted by Heroku. You can send request to the application on http://localhost:8081/
If you run the code localy it is a better idea to install your own Postgre database.  The localhost database is currently marked as a comment.

If you simply want to use this backend as a service, you can access a deployed version through https://mastertoolbackend.herokuapp.com/
